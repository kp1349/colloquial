Homepage: index.php
MySQL is connected in: connect.php
All the php files are kept in the root directory

To set up the database connection, go to the 'connect.php' file. There,
you can set the parameters and turn on '$DEBUG' so that you can see
every time a connection is made and where it was successful or not.

To see all the SQL statements made throughout the program in real time, go
into 'index.php' and set the '$DEBUG' value to 'True'. This will affect all
the other files.

To log into the site, either register, or refer to the 'passwords.txt' that
contains pre-made accounts. It contains the username, the password, and the
md5 hash value of the password(just in case).

The site is very user-friendly and should be self-explanatory. However,
here are some instructions for those that want them:
index.php is the home page, if you are logged in, you will see your
upcoming events, an option to see all the events you have rsvp'd or
un-rsvp'd to(you can un-rsvp or re-rsvp there), an option to select a group
(one that you are a member of) to see all the other members of that group so
that you can add any of them as your friends (assuming you haven't already), a
list of all your friends, some options(create group, interest, etc.), an option
to see all the events in a date range(here you can RSVP to all the events from
groups that you are a member of), and an option select an interest to see all
the groups that have linked that interest to their club.

enjoy colloquial :)
